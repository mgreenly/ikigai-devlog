We finally spent ten minutes on production value. The Ikigai Devlog YouTube channel now has actual thumbnails instead of random freeze frames, courtesy of Google's image generation throwing robot illustrations at us until something stuck.

The channel has been quietly accumulating streams and release videos over the past few weeks. We're typically streaming a couple times a week, walking through whatever we're building in real time. With releases settling into a roughly every-other-week cadence going forward, each one will get its own video walkthrough too.
