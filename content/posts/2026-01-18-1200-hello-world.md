Welcome to the Ikigai Devlog! This is where we'll be documenting the journey of building [Ikigai](https://github.com/mgreenly/ikigai), following along with development progress, design decisions, and the techniques and tools being used along the way.

## What is Ikigai?

Ikigai is an evolving project that you can follow at [github.com/mgreenly/ikigai](https://github.com/mgreenly/ikigai). This devlog exists to provide insight into the development process, share lessons learned, and explain the technical approaches we're taking.

## What to Expect

This devlog will cover:

- **Development progress** - Regular updates on what's being built and what's working
- **Technical deep dives** - Explanations of the tools, languages, and techniques being used
- **Design decisions** - The reasoning behind architectural choices and trade-offs
- **Challenges and solutions** - Real problems encountered and how we're solving them

## About This Site

This devlog is itself a small static site generator built with Ruby scripts. The content is written in Markdown and transformed into a simple, fast-loading blog. Even the tooling for this site is part of the learning and building process.

Looking forward to sharing this journey with you!
