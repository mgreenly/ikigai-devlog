I wanted to share a bit about the name **Ikigai**.

It's a Japanese word that translates most literally to "reason for being," but Google offers a richer description:

> The intersection of what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for.

A friend shared this word with me at a time when I was looking for a side project to sink some energy into. It felt like the perfect fit for this project.

It's pronounced *ee-kee-guy*:
